pinMode()
Last revision

Description
Configures the specified pin to behave either as an 
INPUT
 or an 
OUTPUT
.
See the 
Digital Pins
 page for details on the functionality of the pins.
It is possible to enable the internal pull-up resistors with the mode 
INPUT_PULLUP
. Additionally, the 
INPUT
 mode explicitly disables the internal pull-up.
Syntax
Use the following function to set the behavior of a pin:
pinMode
(
pin
,
 mode
)
Parameters
The function admits the following parameters:
pin
: the Arduino pin number to set the mode of.
mode
: 
INPUT
, 
OUTPUT
, or 
INPUT_PULLUP
. See the 
Digital Pins
 page for a more complete description of the functionality.
Returns
The function returns 
nothing
.
Example Code
Set the Arduino digital pin 13 (built-in LED) as an 
OUTPUT
 and toggles it by alternating between 
HIGH
 and 
LOW
 at one second pace.

)
;
            
// waits for a second
8
  
digitalWrite
(
13
,
 
LOW
)
;
  
// sets the digital pin 13 off
9
  
delay
(
1000
)
;
            
// waits for a second

}
Notes and Warnings
The analog input pins can be used as digital pins, referred to as A0, A1, etc. The exception are the Arduino Nano, Arduino Pro Mini, and Arduino Mini’s A6 and A7 pins, which can only be used as analog inputs.
