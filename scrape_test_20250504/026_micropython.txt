MicroPython
Arduino is adding the Python language as an additional option for programming microcontrollers. Our platform of choice is  
MicroPython
. We support the official MicroPython project by contributing to the upstream repo.
To load MicroPython scripts to your board, you need to use a code editor. There are two editors to choose from:
            

              Arduino Lab for MicroPython
            

            and the
            

              OpenMV
