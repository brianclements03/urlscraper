MKR Vidor 4000

End of Life

The Arduino MKR Vidor 4000 is without a doubt the most advanced and featured-packed board in the MKR family, and the only one with a FPGA chip on board. With a camera & HDMI connector, a Wi-Fi® / Bluetooth® module and up to 25 configurable pins, the sky is really the limit with this board.

The MKR VIDOR 4000 is nothing less than a powerhouse of a board, packing a huge set of features into a small form factor. It features the Intel® Cyclone® 10CL016 for FPGA (Field Programming Gate Array), allowing you to configure a large set of pins to accommodate any of your preferences. But why stop there? The board also has a camera connector, a Micro HDMI connector, Wi-Fi / Bluetooth® connectivity through the NINA-W102 module, and cyber-security through the ECC508 crypto chip. Just as the other members of the MKR family, it uses the popular Cortex-M0 32-bit SAMD21 microprocessor.
