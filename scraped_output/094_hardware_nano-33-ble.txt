Nano 33 BLE

End of Life

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE shares its pinout with the classic Arduino Nano but builds on the nRF52840 microcontroller with 1MB CPU Flash Memory. Featuring a 9 axis inertial measurement unit and the possibility for Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity it can help you to create your next Bluetooth® Low Energy enabled project.

Core

Arm® Mbed™ OS

Arm® Mbed™ OS is an open-source operating system which the Nano 33 BLE builds upon. It’s the same operating system as the Arduino Portenta H7, which allows for Arduino APIs to be integrated using APIs exposed directly by Mbed OS.
