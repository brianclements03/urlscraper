MicroPython

Arduino is adding the Python language as an additional option for programming microcontrollers. Our platform of choice is MicroPython. We support the official MicroPython project by contributing to the upstream repo.

To load MicroPython scripts to your board, you need to use a code editor. There are two editors to choose from: Arduino Lab for MicroPython and the OpenMV
